# A recursive function calls itself in the function body

# any base case it will keep calling itself resulting in stackoverflow

# A recursive function should have 3 important features:
# 1. The recursive case - the case for which the function should call itself again.
# 2. The base case - the case for which the function should end and return the result
# 3. The returns - the function should have a return for both the cases.

# Exercise 1 - Find the error
"""
The following function has an error. The function is supposed to return True when counter is greater than 3,
but it seem to be returning 'None'. Can you figure the error?
